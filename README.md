# tat-cypress-basico-v2
Samples created based on the Cypress Basic - course provided by TAT.

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions v16.13.0 and 8.3.0 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
The scripts can run simulating a web application or a mobile viewport.

### Web
Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.

### Mobile
Run npm test:mobile (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run npm run cy:open:mobile to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
